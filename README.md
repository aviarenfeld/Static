# Static
A static site using sass and gulp.

#Usage

tl;dr: See the example directory in this repo for a sample site.

Add the required npm packages to your site, by running yarn add --dev gulp sites (or npm install --save-dev gulp sites if using
npm rather than Yarn).

Run gulp serve to open the site in your browser. This uses BrowserSync, so any edits to the CSS or HTML files will automatically refresh the browser!

Run gulp build to build the production version of the site. The _output directory is now fully optimized and ready to push to production!
